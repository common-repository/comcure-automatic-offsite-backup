Comcure is an automatic daily backup service for websites files and databases with secure cloud storage and versioning.


== Description ==

Comcure is an automatic daily backup service for websites files and databases with secure cloud storage and versioning.

Comcure securely backs up your site into the cloud via FTP(S) or SSH, noting any changes and creates a snapshot. You can rewind your site to any snapshot, up to 60 days old. 
MySQL databases can also be backed up along with your site files. Comcure will also monitor your site for known viruses and malware on a daily basis and alert you immediately 
so you can rewind your site to its last clean state. We use SSL and 256bit AES encryption to ensure that your backups are always securely transferred and hosted in our highly 
secured data centers.
